# Cyclistic-Bike-Usage-Analysis

## Overview 
This project analyzes historical bike-share usage data for Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company in Chicago. The goal is to uncover actionable insights that will inform the company’s marketing strategy to convert more casual riders into annual members.

## Objective 
Cyclistic’s marketing team wants to understand:

How casual and annual riders behave differently

When and where do rides occur most frequently?

What business insights can help improve conversion rates?


## Tools Used 
Excel & R – For data cleaning, filtering, and pivot tables

Tableau - Data visualization and interactive dashboards

Descriptive Statistics – To identify trends and usage behavior

## Key Insights 
Annual members take more weekday trips, especially during commuting hours

Casual riders favor weekends and tourist-heavy routes

Significant opportunity to market membership to casual users via weekday promotions and loyalty rewards

## Business Recommendations 
Launch a targeted email campaign promoting discounted weekday membership

Partner with hotels and tourism boards for casual-to-member trials

Create in-app popups encouraging casual riders to upgrade.
